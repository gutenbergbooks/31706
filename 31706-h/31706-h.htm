<h2 id="preface">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>The purpose held in view by those who place the study
of Milton in high school English courses is twofold: first,
that youth may seasonably become acquainted with a portion
of our great classic poetry; and, secondly, that they
may in this poetry encounter and learn to conquer difficulties
more serious than those they have met in the literature
they have hitherto read. It is for the teacher to see to it
that both these aims are attained. The pupil must read
with interest, and he must expect at the same time to have
to do some strenuous thinking and not to object to turning
over many books.</p>
<p>The average pupil will not at first read anything of Milton
with perfect enjoyment. He will, with his wonted
docility, commit passages to memory, and he will do his
best to speak these passages with the elocution on which
you insist. But the taste for this poetry is an acquired
one, and in the acquisition usually costs efforts quite alien
to the prevailing conceptions of reading as a pleasurable
recreation.</p>
<p>The task of pedagogy at this point becomes delicate.
First of all, the teacher must recognize the fact that his
class will not, however good their intentions, leap to a
liking for Comus or Lycidas or even for the Nativity
<span class="pb">[vii]</span>
Ode. It is of no use to assign stanzas or lines as lessons
and to expect these to be studied to a conclusion like a task
of French translation. The only way not to be disappointed
in the performance of the class is to expect nothing. It
will be well at first, except where the test is quite simple,
for the teacher to read it himself, making comment, in the
way of explanation, as he goes on. Now and then he will
stop and have a little quiz to hold attention. When classical
allusions come up requiring research, the teacher will
tell in what books the matter may be looked up, and will
show how other poets, or Milton elsewhere, have played
with the same piece of history or mythology. Thus a poem
may be dealt with for a number of days. Repetition is, to
a certain extent, excellent. The verses begin to sink into
the young minds; the measure appeals to the inborn sense
of rhythm; the poem is caught by the ear like a piece of
music; the utterance of it becomes more like singing than
speaking. In fact, the great secret of teaching poetry in
school is to get rid of the commonplace manner of speech
befitting a recitation in language or science, and to put in
practice the obvious truth that verse has its own form,
which is very different from the form of prose. But repetition
may go too far. Over-familiarity may beget indifference.
Other poems await the attention of the class.</p>
<p>The teacher who really means to interest his classes, and
begins by being interested and interesting himself, will
rarely fail to accomplish his purpose. The principal
obstacle to success here is the necessity, that frequently
exists, of conforming to the custom of examining, marking,
and ranking&mdash;a practice that thwarts genuine personal
<span class="pb">[viii]</span>
influence, formalizes all procedures, and tends to deaden
natural interest by substituting for it the artificial interest
of school standing. The Milton lesson must be a serious
one because it is given to the study of the serious work of
the gravest and most high-minded of men; and it must be
an enjoyable one because it deals with the verse of the
most musical of poets, and because one mood of joy is the
only mood in which literature can be profitably studied.</p>
<p>As to the difficulties which the learner first encounters
when he comes to Milton, these grow sometimes out of the
diction, sometimes out of the syntax, and sometimes out
of the poet&rsquo;s figures and allusions. Some difficulties can
be explained at once and completely. Others cannot be
explained at all with any reasonable hope of touching the
beginner&rsquo;s mind with matter that he can appropriate.
Often the young reader slips over points of possible learned
annotation without the least consciousness that here great
scholarship might make an imposing display. Perfectly
useless is it to set forth for the pupil the interesting echoes
from ancient poets which generations of delving scholars
have accumulated in their notes to Milton, pleasing as these
are to mature readers.</p>
<p>The rule should be to expound and illustrate sufficiently
to remove those perplexities which really tease the pupil&rsquo;s
mind and cause him to feel dissatisfaction with himself. In
many cases our only course is to postpone exposition and
to trust that the learner will grow up to the insight which
he as yet does not possess and which we cannot possibly
give him. A learned writer, like Milton, who has read all
antiquity, and who has no purpose of writing for children,
<span class="pb">[ix]</span>
inevitably contemplates a public of men approximately
his equals in culture, and expects to find &ldquo;fit audience,
though few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But many of the difficulties that confront the beginner in
Milton ask only to be explained at once by some one who
has had more experience in the older literature. Archaic
forms of words and expressions, with which the ripe student
is familiar, worry the tyro, and must be accounted for.
Often the common dictionaries will give all needed help;
but the best means of acquiring speedy familiarity with
obsolete and rare forms is a Milton concordance&mdash;such as
that of Bradshaw&mdash;in connection with the Century Dictionary,
or with the Oxford Dictionary, so far as this goes.
These means of easy research should be at hand. I find
that pupils often need a pretty sharp spur to make them use
even their abridged dictionaries. But so far as concerns
acquaintance with the vocabulary of poetic diction, nothing
will do except the dictionary habit, accompanied by an effort
of the memory to retain what has been learned.</p>
<p>Difficulties that lurk in an involved syntax the pupil may
usually be expected to solve by study. But such a peculiar
construction as that in <a href="#r9_10_9">Sonnet X 9</a> will
probably have to be explained to him.</p>
<p>In the puritan theology and its implications he cannot
take much interest, and will of course not be asked to do so.
But high school students of Milton will ordinarily, in their
historical courses, have come down to the times in which
the poet lived, will understand his relation to public events,
and will appreciate his feeling toward the English ecclesiastical
system. Puritanism, a phenomenon of the most
<span class="pb">[x]</span>
tremendous importance at a certain period of English history,
has so completely disappeared from the modern world,
that the utterances of a seventeenth-century poet, professedly
a partisan, on matters of church and state, no longer
exasperate, and can barely even interest, students of literature.</p>
<p>To read either Paradise Lost or the Divine Comedy we
must find the poet&rsquo;s cosmical and his theological standpoint.
We have no right to be surprised or shocked at his
conceptions. We must take him as he is, and let him lead
us through the universe as he has planned it. So long as
we set up our modern views as a standard, and by this standard
judge the ancient men, we fail in hospitality of thought,
and come short of our duty as readers.</p>
<p>This consideration suggests yet another purpose in setting
youth to the reading of Milton. By no means an ancient
poet, he takes us, nevertheless, to a world different from our
own, and in some sense helps us out of the modern time in
which our lives have fallen, to show us how other ages conceived
of God and Heaven. The mark of an educated
man is respect for the past; the old philosophies and religions
do not startle and repel him; his ancestors were once
in those stages of belief; in some stage of this vast movement
of thought he and his fellows are at the present
moment. This largeness of view can be fruitfully impressed
on youth only by letting them read, under wise
guidance, the older poets.</p>
<div class="pb">[xi]</div>
<h2 id="c0">OUTLINES OF THE LIFE OF MILTON.</h2>
<p>John Milton was born in London on the ninth of
December, 1608. Queen Elizabeth had then been dead five
years, and the literature which we call Elizabethan was still
being written by the men who had begun their careers
under her reign. Spenser had died in 1599. The theatres
were yet in the enjoyment of full popularity, and the play-writers
were producing works that continued the traditions
and the manner of the Elizabethan drama. Shakespeare
had still eight years to live, and at least four of the great
plays to write. Bacon&rsquo;s fame was already great, but the
events of eighteen years were to cloud his reputation and
establish his renown. Jonson, great as a writer of masks,
was to live till he might have seen, in Comus, how a young
and scholarly puritan humanist thought that a mask should
be conceived.</p>
<p>Born thus in the fifth year of the first of the Stuarts,
Milton lived to witness all the vicissitudes of English politics
in which that family was involved, except the very
last. He did not see the Revolution of 1688. Surviving
for fourteen years the restoration of Charles II., he died in
1674, at the age of sixty-six.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s social position can be inferred from the fact that
his father was what was then called a scrivener,&mdash;that is,
he kept an office in his dwelling, and was employed to draw
up contracts, wills, and other legal documents. This occupation
<span class="pb">[xii]</span>
implied knowledge at least of the forms of the law,
though not of its history or principles. It did not imply
liberal education, though it brought its practitioner, doubtless,
more or less into contact with men of really professional
standing in the science of jurisprudence. Perhaps the
elder Milton cherished a deeper conviction of the value of
classic culture than do those who simply inherit, and take
as a matter of course, the custom of devoting years to the
study of ancient languages and literatures.</p>
<p>Evidently the father thought he saw in his son that
promise of intellectual vigor and of sound moral stamina
which justified the innovation, in his family, of sending his
boy to the university. His preparation for college Milton
got under private masters and at the famous public school
of St. Paul&rsquo;s, which was near his home. This preparation
consisted chiefly in exercises in Latin composition and
literature, and was both thorough and effectual. At sixteen,
when he went to college, he had already composed
Latin verse, and he read and wrote Latin with facility.</p>
<p>In 1625 Milton entered Christ&rsquo;s College, Cambridge.
Here he remained as a student seven years, or till 1632,
taking in course his A.B. and A.M. degrees, and, in spite
of his studious habits and his aversion to the rough and
wayward customs of student life, winning more and more,
and at last having in full measure, the respect of his fellow-collegians.
During these years he wrote, but did not publish,
in Latin or English, no less than twenty-five pieces of
verse, among them poems of no less note than the Nativity
Ode, and the Sonnet on arriving at the age of twenty-three.
The lines on Shakespeare were also composed in this period,
and appeared in print among the poems prefixed to the
second Shakespeare folio in 1632.</p>
<p>Returning, at the close of his university course, to the
<span class="pb">[xiii]</span>
paternal residence, the poet came, not to London, but to the
village of Horton, in Buckinghamshire, where his father
had taken a house in order to live in the country. Now had
to be debated the question of a profession. Hitherto the
son had seemed silently to acquiesce in the understood hope
of the family that he would devote himself to a career in
the church. But during his university years of study
and observation his views had become fixed, his mind had
advanced to self-determination, and he could not remain
content with a future that seemed to hamper his intellectual
freedom. This difference between father and son was
settled, apparently without strife, by the elder man&rsquo;s entire
yielding to the desires of the younger. The son could not,
as we can well understand if we have read even only a little
of his verse or his prose, be otherwise than strenuous, insistent,
and masterful. To his father he was of course filial
and respectful, we may imagine him even gentle; but conciliatory,
yielding, the point being a vital one, it was not in
his nature to be.</p>
<p>What the young Milton desired was to lead a life devoted
to literature, or, more specifically, to poetry. This meant
that he wished still to study a long time, to fathom all learning
in all tongues. In college he had, besides Latin, mastered
Greek, French, Italian, and Hebrew. His conception
of a poet was of a most profoundly learned man. He had
become aware of the existence of vast areas of knowledge
that he had not yet explored. Other young men turned
aside without misgiving from the ambition to know everything,
and eagerly entered into useful and lucrative professions.
But Milton scorns the thought of applying learning
to the service of material gain. This is his poetical conception
of his duty as a scholar. It will dominate the spirit
of his life work. To understand his feelings at this time
<span class="pb">[xiv]</span>
both toward his father and toward his ideals, we must read
the Latin poem <i>Ad Patrem</i>, of which Professor Masson gives
an English translation.</p>
<p>At Horton, therefore, Milton remains, still subsisting on
his father&rsquo;s bounty. Having come back thither at the age
of twenty-three, he continues to live at home for nearly six
years, not yet practising any art by which to earn a livelihood.
Occasionally he goes, on scholarly errands, to London,
which is not far distant. He devotes himself simply
to study, and having the poetic temperament, he cannot
help devoting himself also to observation of nature. His
learning becomes immense; his appetite is insatiable.</p>
<p>To the Horton time belong the &ldquo;minor poems&rdquo; not already
produced during the student years at Cambridge. Of the circumstances
in which the several poems were written, an account
is given in the Notes in this volume. This early, or
minor, verse of Milton is elicited by passing events, and is
considered to concern only himself and a few friends. For
immediate fame he takes no thought. He feels his immaturity.
His ambition contemplates a distant future, and he
meditates plans, as yet undefined and vague, of some great
work that the world shall not willingly let die.</p>
<p>Very important in Milton&rsquo;s intellectual development is his
journey to France and Italy, on which he set out in April,
1638. As an indication of his social position in England,
we must note that he carries with him letters of introduction
which secure to him notice and recognition from men of
rank or of notable literary and scientific standing. He goes
abroad as a cultivated private gentleman, known to have
achieved distinction as a student. Undoubtedly his chief
qualification for holding his own in learned Italian society
was his command of languages, especially of Latin, unless
indeed we are to put before his linguistic accomplishments
<span class="pb">[xv]</span>
the refined and gentlemanly personal bearing which was his
birthright, and which, in his years of intense application to
books, he had not forfeited. In Italy he associated with
men whose intellectual interests were the universal ones of
science, in which he was as much at home as they. Thus
he possessed a perfect outfit of the endowments and the
acquisitions which a traveller needs to make his travel fruitful
to himself and honorable to his country.</p>
<p>In Italy he made friends among men of note, and established
relations which were to have their importance in his
future life. But most memorable among his Italian experiences
was his visit to the aged Galileo, who was then a
&ldquo;prisoner to the Inquisition&rdquo; for teaching that the earth
moves round the sun. The modern astronomy was then
winning its way among men of thought very much as the
doctrine of evolution has been winning its way during the
last half century. Few minds surrendered instantly and
without misgiving to the new conception. Milton has still
many years to meditate the question before he comes to
the composition of Paradise Lost, when his scheme of
the physical universe will have to recognize the requirements
of poetic art and the prevalence of ancient beliefs
regarding the origin and order of the cosmos. From the
fact that the poet puts the earth in the centre of the universe,
that he adopts, in fact, the Ptolemaic system, though
he knew the Copernican, we are not entitled to infer that
he held a fixed conviction in the matter, and that, on direct
examination as to his views, he would have absolutely professed
one theory and rejected the other. The poet has all
rights of choice, and may be said to know best where to
stand to take his view of the world.</p>
<p>Milton remained abroad some sixteen months, and was
home again in August, 1639. The Horton household was
<span class="pb">[xvi]</span>
now broken up, the father going to live, first with his
younger son, Christopher, at Reading, and afterward to
spend his last years in the family of John in London,
where he died in 1647.</p>
<p>With his removal to London in 1639 a distinct period in
Milton&rsquo;s life comes to an end. He has hitherto been uninterruptedly
acquiring knowledge both by studious devotion
to books and by observation of human life in foreign
lands. He has read all the great literatures in ancient and
modern languages. He has felt the poetic impulse and has
proved to himself that he has at command creative power.
His purpose still is to produce a poem. But this poem of
his aspirations is distinctly a great and majestic affair, and
not at all a continuation of such work as that which he has
hitherto given to his friends, and which he esteems as
prolusions of his youth.</p>
<p>The poetic waiting-time which Milton, now in full vigor
of manhood, prescribes for himself, he is constrained, both
by inner conviction and by external necessity, to fill with
hard and earnest work. Henceforth, for a score of years,
he ceases almost entirely to write verse, and he earns his
living. He becomes a householder in London, where, as
the father had gained his livelihood by drawing up contracts
and mortgages for his fellow-citizens, the son proceeds
to gain his by teaching their boys Latin.</p>
<p>To the work of teaching, Milton addressed himself with
intelligence and predilection. About education he had
ideas of his own which he applied in practice and advocated
in writing. His Tract on Education is a document of importance
in the history of pedagogy, and is, besides, one
of those memorable pieces of English prose which every
student of literature, whatever his professional aims, must
include in his reading. He kept his school in his own
<span class="pb">[xvii]</span>
house, where he boarded some of his pupils. We could not
imagine John Milton going into a great public school, like
St. Paul&rsquo;s, to serve as under-teacher to one of the tyrannical
head-masters of the day. The only school befitting his
absolutely convinced and masterful spirit is one in which
he reigns supreme. The great subject is Latin, and so
thoroughly is Latin taught that finally other subjects are
explained through the medium of this language. He had,
himself, brought from his school and college days very
decided discontent with the methods then in vogue. This
discontent he expresses in language of peculiar energy and
even harshness. He is a true reformer.</p>
<p>In 1643 Milton, then thirty-five years old, married Mary
Powell, a girl of just half his own age, daughter of a royalist
residing near Oxford. We must imagine this young
wife as coming to preside, somewhat in the capacity of
matron, over a family of boys held severely to their tasks
of study by a master in whom the sense of humor was
almost entirely lacking, and whose discipline was of the
sternest. That she could not endure the situation was but
natural. Very soon after the wedding she went home with
the understanding that she was to make a short visit to her
parents and sisters; but she did not return for two years.
Her husband summoned her, but she would not come back.
In 1645 she at last repented of her waywardness, sought
reconciliation, and was forgiven. These two years had
wrought a change in Mary Powell Milton. She was now
ready to live with her husband, and did so till her death in
1652. She left him three daughters, the youngest of whom,
Deborah, lived till 1723, and was known to Addison and
his contemporaries, from whom she received distinguished
honors.</p>
<p>In reading Milton we find that all the vicissitudes of his
<span class="pb">[xviii]</span>
life reflect themselves in his works, so that the political and
social events in which he is personally concerned usurp his
attention, color his views, and often become his themes.
Thus he is not, like Shakespeare, a critic of the whole of
humanity, but is usually an advocate or an accuser of the
leaders in church and state and of the principles which they
profess. He is by nature a partisan. All the energy of his
mind goes into denunciation or vindication. His experience
of wedded life made him an advocate of easier divorce, and
determined in him a mood which expressed itself in writings
that naturally brought upon him obloquy even from
those who held him most in honor.</p>
<p>It would be most interesting to know something of the
daily routine of Milton&rsquo;s school, to ascertain what his pupils
knew and could do when he had done with them. But we
must remember that during all the years of his teaching
the great Revolution was in progress, that all men of thought
were profoundly stirred on public questions, and that Milton
himself was a politician and an eager partisan of the cause
of Parliament. He did not consider himself a teacher finally
and for good. His school did not develop into anything
great or conspicuous, and never became an object of curiosity.
While yet engaged in such teaching as he found to do, he
had written the pamphlets on education and on divorce, and
also the famous one entitled Areopagitica, a Speech for the
Liberty of Unlicensed Printing to the Parliament of England.
This is the best worth reading of all his prose writings.
The subject of it is perfectly intelligible still, and
its English shows to perfection the qualities of the great
Miltonic style.</p>
<p>After the execution of Charles I., Jan. 30, 1649, it became
more than ever necessary for all thoughtful men to express
their convictions. For a people to put to death its king by
<span class="pb">[xix]</span>
judicial process was an unheard of event. Those who considered
that the Parliament had acted within the law and
could not have done otherwise with due regard to the welfare
of the nation had to convince doubting and timid citizens
at home, and also, so far as was possible, to placate critics
in other nations who still believed that the king could do no
wrong; for all Europe interested itself in this tremendous
act of the English Parliament.</p>
<p>Within a fortnight after the death of the king, Milton
published his pamphlet on The Tenure of Kings and Magistrates.
This work so impressed the parliamentary leaders
as a thorough and unanswerable argument in defence of their
cause that they sought out its author, and in March appointed
him to the important post of Secretary for Foreign Tongues.
Milton&rsquo;s perfect command of Latin now stood him in good
stead. Here was an uncompromising puritan, fully the equal
of the foreign ecclesiastics in theology, and capable of holding
his own in Latin composition with the most famous
humanists of the time. Latin was then the language of
international intercourse. Milton&rsquo;s duty was to translate
into and from Latin the despatches that passed between his
own and foreign governments. He also composed original
treatises, some in English and some in Latin, the most important
of which continued his justification of the national
act of regicide. The importance of these writings was very
great. Milton&rsquo;s services to the puritan cause can to-day
hardly be appreciated. It was the constant aim of royalists
at home and abroad to represent England as having fallen
under the control of ignorant fanatics, of ambitious, barbarous,
blood-thirsty men. By his very personality, his knowledge
of affairs, his familiarity with ancient and medi&aelig;val
history, and, above all, by his fluency in Latin invective,
Milton thwarted attempts to disparage his countrymen as
<span class="pb">[xx]</span>
lawless barbarians. He helped to maintain the good name
of his country as a land of intellectual light and of respect
for ancient usage. Foreigners who attempted personal vilification
found him ready to meet them with their own
weapons. The poet of Comus now shows himself a controversialist
of unbounded energy.</p>
<p>In 1652, shortly before the death of his wife, Milton became
totally blind. Henceforward the duties of his secretaryship
had to be performed with the aid of an amanuensis.
He continued, however, to fill the office till just before the
end of the Protectorate in 1659. In November, 1656, he
married Katharine Woodcocke, who lived but till March,
1658. She left an infant which died a month after the
mother.</p>
<p>Milton&rsquo;s duties as Secretary for Foreign Tongues must
have brought him, one would think, into some sort of personal
relation with Cromwell and the other great parliamentary
leaders. The poet leaves us in no doubt as to the high
esteem in which he held these men. But no gossip of the
time admits us to a glimpse of their intercourse with each
other. It falls to Milton to eulogize Cromwell; it never
came in Cromwell&rsquo;s way to put on record his estimate of
Milton.</p>
<p>With the restoration of royalty in the person of Charles
II., in 1660, Milton&rsquo;s public activity of course ceased, and the
second period of his life comes to an end. We saw his first
period devoted to preparation and to early essays in poetry,
with the distinct conception that poetry was yet to be the
great work of his life. In his second period he expresses
himself in verse but rarely and briefly, but produces controversial
prose, now in English, now in Latin. In this second
period he works, as teacher or as public secretary, for
payment, supporting himself and family. When the third
<span class="pb">[xxi]</span>
period begins, he loses all employment, goes into closest
retirement, a widower with three daughters growing up
from childhood, and devotes himself to the poetry that he
has always contemplated as the object of his ambition. He
has now been blind eight years.</p>
<p>In view of the conspicuous part that Milton had taken in
defending the right of Parliament to bring a king to the
scaffold, it is surprising that of the Restoration he was not
included in the number of those marked out for the punishment
of death. He was for some time undoubtedly in
danger. Fortunately he was overlooked, or, perhaps, was
purposely neglected as being henceforce harmless.</p>
<p>In February, 1663, he married his third wife Elizabeth
Minshull, who faithfully cared for him till his death in
1674.</p>
<p>During this last period of his life Milton composed and
published his <i>major</i> poems,&mdash;Paradise Lost, 1667, Paradise
Regained, and Samson Agonistes, 1671. For Paradise Lost
he received from his publisher five pounds in cash, with
promise of five pounds when thirteen hundred copies should
have been sold, and of two more payments, each of the
same sum, when two more editions of the same size should
have been disposed of.</p>
<p>The last years of his life Milton appears to have spent in
comparative comfort. His three daughters had gone out to
learn trades. It seems he had given them no education. It
may be they showed no desire or aptitude for instruction.
Far more probably, however, he took no interest in their
education. His ideal of womanhood, as may be gathered
from numerous passages in his poems, is as far as possible
removed from the modern conception of sexual equality
as to opportunity for education and for training to self-determination.
He shared in this respect the views that
<span class="pb">[xxii]</span>
prevailed during his day in all classes of society, and he
maintained these views as a parent no less than as the poet
of Paradise.</p>
<p>Besides the poems named above as produced during this
last period of his life, Milton published also in these years
several prose works, which have now little value except as
showing the bent and occupation of his mind. Among these
may be named a small Latin Grammar, written in English,
which he had composed long before, and a History of Britain
to the Norman Conquest.</p>
<p>Though the immediate sale of Paradise Lost was not
large, according to our ideas, it was yet sufficient to indicate
a very respectable interest in the reading public of the day.
We must remember that it appeared in the corrupt time of
the Restoration, when the prevailing literary fashion was
wholly adverse to seriousness and ideality. The age was
spiritually degenerate. Milton himself considered that he
lived &ldquo;an age too late.&rdquo; The great poem had no royal or
noble sponsors to give it vogue; yet it made its way. By
no means had all minds become frivolous. The minor
poems had been published by themselves in 1645. These
had always had their readers. The prose pamphlets of the
secretary for foreign tongues were, at least by a small class
of observant persons, known to be the work of the author
of Comus and Lycidas. There were not wanting men to
take a sympathetic interest in the fate of the poet in his
retirement, and to note the appearance of Paradise Lost as
a literary event.</p>
<p>Thus it was that Milton lived to have some slight foretaste
of the honor which two centuries have bestowed on
his memory. Visitors came to see him in his modest dwelling
in an unfashionable quarter of London. Foreigners
occasionally came to satisfy their curiosity. Dryden, the
<span class="pb">[xxiii]</span>
chief poet who wrote in the spirit of the Restoration, called
to talk with the author of Paradise Lost, and to suggest
improvements in the form of the poem, which he thought
should be in rhyme. The recognition which the poet thus
got in his lifetime is small only in comparison with the
immense fame he has won since his death.</p>
<p>Milton has now become an object of the profoundest
curiosity. His life has been investigated by Professor
Masson, with a minute scrutiny into detail such as has been
devoted to no other writer but Shakespeare. His works
are perpetually reprinted in all imaginable forms, whether
of cheapness or of sumptuous elegance. They are read as
text-books in schools by hosts of youth. Our beliefs regarding
the great themes of the sacred scriptures are so
colored by the Miltonic epics that we hardly know to-day
just what part of our conceptions we owe to the Bible and
what to the poet. Next to the Shakespearean dramas, the
poems of Milton are the largest single influence that knits
the English-speaking race into one vast brotherhood.</p>
<p>All students of Milton have to acknowledge their indebtedness to
Professor
David Masson of Edinburgh, who has
devoted years of labor to research in every department of
Miltonic lore. Masson&rsquo;s great Life of Milton in Connexion
with the History of his Time is far too bulky for use except
for reference on special points. The index volume makes
the enormous Work accessible as occasion requires.</p>
<p>To his edition of the poetical works, Masson prefixes a
life, which will suffice for all the needs likely to arise in
school. Yet again, Masson is the writer of the article on
Milton in the Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, a most complete presentment
of everything a student ordinarily needs to know.</p>
<p>In the series of Classical Writers is a little book, or
primer, on Milton, written by Stopford A. Brooke.</p>
<div class="pb">[xxiv]</div>
<p>In the English Men of Letters series, the
Milton
is the work of Mark Pattison.</p>
<p>The latest good account of Milton is the book entitled simply
John Milton, by
Walter Raleigh, professor at University College, Liverpool. This is
a remarkably vigorous and illuminating piece of criticism.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting writing on a Milton subject
is the book by Mrs. Anne Manning, The Maiden and Married
Life of Mary Powell (afterward Mrs. Milton), and the
sequel thereto, Deborah&rsquo;s Diary. This the student must
read with the full understanding that it is a work of fiction.</p>
<p>It is right to warn young readers against the natural
tendency to give their time to critical and expository books
and articles before they make acquaintance with originals.
Almost every essayist of note has written on Milton.
There is danger lest we accept opinions at second hand.
The only opinions on Milton to which we have any right
are those we form from our own reading of his works.</p>

<h2 id="c10">NOTES.</h2>
<h3>ON THE MORNING OF CHRIST&rsquo;S NATIVITY.</h3>
<p>From his sixteenth year Milton had been wont to write freely in
Latin verse, on miscellaneous poetic themes, sometimes expressing
his thoughts on events of the day, and sometimes addressing letters
to his friends on purely personal matters. From these Latin
poems, which therefore in some sense belong to English literature,
we obtain valuable insight into his course of life and his way of
thinking. What Milton wrote in foreign languages is indispensable
for the information it gives us about himself&mdash;its content is
important; but as poetry implies a fusing of content and form into
an artistic unity, if one of these elements is foreign, the result is
nondescript and cannot be ranged under the head of English literature
in the strict sense of the term.</p>
<p>It is in one of Milton&rsquo;s own Latin pieces that we find our best
commentary on the Hymn on the Nativity. The sixth Latin Elegy
is an epistle to his intimate college friend, &ldquo;Charles Diod&#259;ti making
a stay in the country,&rdquo; the last twelve lines of which may be
freely translated as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="bq">But if you shall wish to know what I am doing,&mdash;if indeed you think
it worth your while to know whether I am doing anything at all,&mdash;we are
singing the peace-bringing king born of heavenly seed, and the happy ages
promised in the sacred books, and the crying of the infant God lying in
a manger under a poor roof, who dwells with his father in the realms
above; and the starry sky, and the squadrons singing on high, and the
gods suddenly driven away to their own fanes. Those gifts we have
indeed given to the birthday of Christ; that first light brought them to
me at dawn. Thee also they await sung to our native pipes; thou shalt be
to me in lieu of a judge for me to read them to.</p>
<div class="pb">[80]</div>
<p>This means, of course, that the poet is composing a Christmas
Hymn in his native language. We must note his age at this time,&mdash;twenty-one
years: he is a student at Cambridge. The poem
remains the great Christmas hymn in our literature. &ldquo;The Ode
on the Nativity,&rdquo; says Professor Saintsbury, &ldquo;is a test of the
reader&rsquo;s power to appreciate poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In four stanzas the poet speaks in his own person: he too must,
with the wise men from the east, bring such gifts as he has, to offer
to the Infant God. His offering is the <i>humble ode</i> which follows.
We must take note of the change in the metric form which marks
the transition from the introduction to the ode. In the stanzas of
the former the lines all have five accents, except the last, which has
six; while in the latter, four lines have three accents each, one has
four, two have five, and one has six. Notice also the occasional
hypermetric lines, such as line 47.</p>
<p>In connection with Milton&rsquo;s Hymn, read Alfred Domett&rsquo;s <i>It was
the calm and silent night</i>.</p>

For poetical purposes Milton everywhere
adopts the popular astronomy of his day, which was based on the
ancient, i.e. the Ptolemaic, or geocentric system of the universe.
Copernicus had already taught the modern, heliocentric theory of the
<span class="pb">[81]</span>
solar system, and his innovations were not unknown to Milton, who,
however, consistently adheres to the old conceptions. In Milton, therefore,
we find the earth the centre of the visible universe, while the
sun, the planets, and the fixed stars revolve about it in their several
<i>spheres</i>. These spheres are nine in number, arranged concentrically,
like the coats of an onion, about the earth, and, if of solid matter, are
to be conceived as being of perfectly transparent crystal. Beginning
with the innermost, they present themselves in the following order:
the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the Fixed
Stars, the Primum Mobile. In Par. Lost III 481, the ninth sphere
appears as &ldquo;that crystalline sphere whose balance weighs the trepidation
talked,&rdquo; and the Primum Mobile, or the first moved, becomes the
tenth and outermost of the series. The last two spheres contain no
stars.</p>
<p class="cont">We see, then, what we must understand by the oft-recurring <i>spheres</i>
in Milton&rsquo;s poetry. In the line, <i>Down through the turning sphere</i>,
however, the singular <i>sphere</i> is obviously used to mean the whole aggregate
of spheres composing the starry universe.</p>

<h3>ON SHAKESPEARE.</h3>
<p>The first edition of the collected works of Shakespeare, known as
the first folio, was published in 1623, when Milton was fifteen years
old. The second Shakespeare folio appeared in 1632. Among the
commendatory verses by various hands prefixed, after the fashion
of the time, to the latter volume, was a little piece of eight couplets,
in which some then unknown rhymer expressed his admiration of
the great poet. Collecting his poems for publication in 1645,
Milton included these couplets, gave them the date 1630, and the
title <i>On Shakespeare</i> which they have since borne in his works.
The fact that he wrote the verses two years before their publication
in the Shakespeare folio shows that he did not produce them to
order, for the special occasion. It is interesting to note that Milton
at twenty-two was an appreciative reader of Shakespeare. The
lines themselves give no hint of great poetic genius; they are a fair
specimen of the conventional, labored eulogy in vogue at the time.</p>

<h3>L&rsquo;ALLEGRO AND IL PENSEROSO.</h3>
<p>The year in which the poems were composed is uncertain.
Masson regards 1632 as the probable date.</p>
<p>The exquisite poems to which Milton gave the Italian titles
L&rsquo;Allegro,&mdash;the mirthful, or jovial, man,&mdash;and Il Penseroso,&mdash;the
melancholy, or saturnine, man,&mdash;should be regarded each as
the pendant and complement of the other, and should be read as a
single whole. The poet knew both moods, and takes both standpoints
with equal grace and heartiness. The essential idea of thus
contrasting the mirthful and the melancholy temperament he
found ready to his hand. Robert Burton had prefaced his
<i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>, published in 1621, with a series of not unpleasing,
though by no means graceful, am&oelig;bean stanzas, in which
two speakers alternately represent Melancholy, one as sweet and
divine, and the other as harsh, sour, and damned. Undoubtedly
Milton knew his Burton. But if he got his main idea from this
source, he made his poems thoroughly Miltonic by his art of visualizing
in delicious pictures the various phases of his abstract
theme. The poems are wholly poetical, equally free from obscurity
of thought and from obscurity of expression.</p>
<p>Each poem is prefaced with a vigorous exorcism of the spirit to
<span class="pb">[86]</span>
which it is hostile. This is couched in alternate three and five
accent iambics, preparing a delicious rhythmic effect when the
metre changes, in the invocation, to the octosyllable, with or without
anacrusis.</p>
<p>In L&rsquo;Allegro we accompany the mirthful man through an entire
day of his pleasures, from early morning to late evening. The
melancholy man moves through a programme less definitely and
regularly planned. The scenes of his delights are mostly in the
hours of the night: when the sun is up, he hides himself from day&rsquo;s
garish eye.</p>
<h4><span class="sc">L&rsquo;Allegro.</span></h4>
<div class="notes">
<p><a class="rref" id="n3_2" href="#r3_2">2. Of Cerberus and blackest Midnight born.</a> Milton follows the
example of the ancient poets in announcing the parentage of the principal
beings whom he brings upon his stage. Moreover, he uses the
ancient freedom in assigning mythical pedigrees, not only adopting no
authority as a canon, but allowing his own fancy to invent origins as
suits his purpose. He knew the Greek and Latin poets, and assumed
for himself the privilege which they exercised of shaping the myths as
they pleased. We are not therefore to seek in Milton a reproduction
of any system of mythology. <i>Cerberus</i> was the terrible three-headed
dog of Pluto. His station was at the entrance to the lower world, or
the <i>Stygian cave</i>.</p>

According to Dionysius there were nine orders or ranks of beings in

<h3>AT A SOLEMN MUSIC.</h3>
<p>The poet listens to what in the phrase of his time is a <i>solemn
music</i>, but which we should name a sacred concert. The poem is
<span class="pb">[96]</span>
unalloyed lyric, expressing the rapture to which the music has
lifted his soul. We must remember that Milton was himself an
amateur musician, and in his days of darkness found habitual
diversion at his organ. Indications of a susceptible and appreciative
ear for musical harmony are frequent throughout the poems.</p>

<h3 id="n7_0">COMUS.</h3>
<p>During the reigns of Elizabeth, James I., and Charles I., the <i>mask</i>
was one of the most popular forms of dramatic entertainment.
Having a function and a character peculiar to itself, it flourished
side by side with the regular plays of the theatrical stage, and gave
large scope to the genius of poets, composers, and scenic artists.</p>
<p>The mask was usually designed to grace some important occasion,
in which members of the upper classes of society, or even
royal personages, were concerned. When the occasion called for
particularly brilliant display, and had been long foreseen, the preparations
for it would involve immense outlays for costumes, theatrical
machinery, for new music, and for a libretto by a play-writer
of the greatest note. When the mask was purely a private one, like
Arcades and Comus, it was all the fashion for the gentle youths
and maidens, for gentlemen and ladies of the highest rank, to take
upon themselves the parts of the drama, to rehearse them assiduously,
and finally to enact them on the private stage or on the lawn
in the presence of a select audience.</p>
<p>The mask thus differentiated itself from the stage play in that
it was not given for the pecuniary behoof of a company of actors,
but represented rather expenditure for the simple purpose of producing
grand effects. To act in a mask was an honor, when common
players were social outcasts. The mask was got up for the
occasion, and was not intended to keep the boards and attract a
paying public. When the august ceremonial was over, the poet
had his manuscript, to increase the bulk of his works, and the composer
had his score, to furnish airs that might be played and sung
in drawing-rooms if they had the good fortune to be popular.</p>
<div class="pb">[97]</div>
<p>Such was the origin of the poem which Milton, in all the editions
published during his lifetime, entitled simply &ldquo;A Maske presented
at Ludlow Castle, 1634,&rdquo; but which editors since his day have
agreed to name Comus.</p>
<p>The occasion of the poem was the coming of the Earl of Bridgewater
to Ludlow Castle, to enter upon his official residence there
as Lord President of Wales. The person chiefly concerned in the
scenic, musical, and histrionic preparations of the mask was
Milton&rsquo;s esteemed friend, the most accomplished musical composer
of the day, Henry Lawes. Lawes composed the music and
arranged the stage business. He seems to have taken upon himself
the part of the Attendant Spirit. Lawes knew to whom to
apply for the all-important matter of the book, the words, or the
poetry, of the piece, for he had learned to know Milton&rsquo;s qualifications
as a mask-poet in the fragment which we have under the
name <i>Arcades</i>. With good music even for commonplace lyric
verse, and with sprightly declamation even of conventional dialogue,
the thing, as we know from modern instances, might have
been carried off by gorgeous costumes and shrewdly devised scenic
effects. Most of the masks of the time fell at once into oblivion.
But Lawes had secured for his poet John Milton; and the consequence
thereof is that the Earl of Bridgewater is now chiefly heard
of because at Ludlow Castle there was enacted, in the form of a
mask written by Milton, a drama which is still read and reread by
every English-speaking person who reads any serious poetry, though
Ludlow Castle has long been a venerable ruin.</p>
<p>For his plot, the poet feigned that the young children of the earl,
two sons and a daughter, in coming to Ludlow, had to pass unattended
through a forest, in which the boys became separated from
the girl and she fell into the hands of the enchanter Comus. The
Attendant Spirit appears to the youths with his magic herb, and
with the further assistance of the water-nymph Sabrina, at last
makes all right, and the children are restored to their parents in
the midst of festive rejoicing.</p>
<p>The poem is dramatic, because it is acted and spoken or sung in
character by its persons. It is allegorical, because it inculcates a
moral, and more is meant than meets the ear. In parts it is pastoral,
<span class="pb">[98]</span>
both because the chief personage appears in the guise of a
shepherd, and because its motive largely depends on the superstitions
and traditions of simple, ignorant folk. In the longer
speeches, where events are narrated with some fulness, it becomes
epic. Lastly, in its songs, in the octosyllables of the magician, and
in the adjuration and the thanking of Sabrina, it is lyric. With
iambic pentameter as the basis of the dialogue, the poet varies his
measures as Shakespeare does his, and with very similar ends in
view.</p>
<p>The name <i>Comus</i> Milton found ready to his hand. As a common
noun, the Greek word <i>comus</i> signifies carousal,&mdash;wassail. In
the later classic period it had become a proper name, standing for
a personification of nocturnal revelry, and a god Comus was frequently
depicted on vases and in mural paintings. Philostratus,
in his <i>Ik&#335;nes</i>,&mdash;or <i>Pictures</i>,&mdash;gives an interesting description of a
painting of this god. See Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica, article <i>Comus</i>.
Ben Jonson, in his mask, <i>Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue</i>, played in
1619, presents a Comus as &ldquo;the god of cheer, or the belly, riding
in triumph, his head crowned with roses and other flowers, his hair
curled.&rdquo; The character and the name were the common property
of mask-writers.</p>
<p>The great distinction of Comus is its beauty, maintained at
height through a thousand lines of supremely perfect verse.
Greatly dramatic it of course is not. It yields its meaning to the
most cursory reading; it has no mystery. It is simply beautiful,
with a sustained beauty elsewhere unparalleled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following letter of Sir Henry Wotton to the Author deserves
to be read both for its engaging style as a piece of English prose
and for its exquisite characterization of Comus. Wotton was a
versatile scholar, diplomat, and courtier, seventy years old at the
time of this letter, with a reputation as a kindly and appreciative
literary critic. He was now residing at Eton College, where he
held the office of Provost. Milton, thirty years of age, the first edition
of his Comus recently published anonymously, had good cause
for elation over such a testimonial from such a source.</p>
<div class="pb">[99]</div>
<p class="jr1">&ldquo;From the College, this 13 of April, 1638.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Sir,</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;It was a special favour when you lately bestowed upon
me here the first taste of your acquaintance, though no longer than to
make me know that I wanted more time to value it and to enjoy it
rightly; and, in truth, if I could then have imagined your farther stay
in these parts, which I understood afterwards by Mr. H., I would have
been bold, in our vulgar phrase, to mend my draught (for you left me
with an extreme thirst), and to have begged your conversation again,
jointly with your said learned friend, over a poor meal or two, that we
might have banded together some good Authors of the ancient time;
among which I observed you to have been familiar.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Since your going, you have charged me with new obligations, both
for a very kind letter from you dated the 6th of this month, and for
a dainty piece of entertainment which came therewith. Wherein I
should much commend the tragical part, if the lyrical did not ravish
me with a certain Doric delicacy in your Songs and Odes, whereunto
I must plainly confess to have seen yet nothing parallel in our language:
<i>Ipsa mollities</i>. But I must not omit to tell you that I now only
owe you thanks for intimating unto me (how modestly soever) the true
artificer. For the work itself I had viewed some good while before
with singular delight; having received it from our common friend Mr.
R., in the very close of the late R.&rsquo;s Poems, printed at Oxford: whereunto
it was added (as I now suppose) that the accessory might help
out the principal, according to the art of Stationers, and to leave the
reader <i>con la bocca dolce</i>.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Now, Sir, concerning your travels; wherein I may challenge a
little more privilege of discourse with you. I suppose you will not
blanch Paris in your way: therefore I have been bold to trouble you
with a few lines to Mr. M. B., whom you shall easily find attending
the young Lord S. as his governor; and you may surely receive from
him good directions for the shaping of your farther journey into Italy
where he did reside, by my choice, some time for the King, after mine
own recess from Venice.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;I should think that your best line will be through the whole length
of France to Marseilles, and thence by sea to Genoa; whence the passage
into Tuscany is as diurnal as a Gravesend barge. I hasten, as
you do, to Florence or Siena, the rather to tell you a short story, from
the interest you have given me in your safety.</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;At Siena I was tabled in the house of one Alberto Scipioni, an old
Roman courtier in dangerous times; having been steward to the Duca
di Pagliano, who with all his family were strangled, save this only man
<span class="pb">[100]</span>
that escaped by foresight of the tempest. With him I had often much
chat of those affairs, into which he took pleasure to look back from his
native harbour; and at my departure toward Rome (which had been
the centre of his experience), I had won his confidence enough to beg
his advice how I might carry myself there without offence of others or
of mine own conscience. &lsquo;<i>Signor Arrigo mio</i>,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;<i>I pensieri
stretti ed il viso sciolto</i> will go safely over the whole world.&rsquo; Of which
Delphian oracle (for so I have found it) your judgment doth need no
commentary; and therefore, Sir, I will commit you, with it, to the best
of all securities, God&rsquo;s dear love, remaining</p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Your friend, as much to command as any of longer date,</p>
<p class="jr1">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Henry Wotton</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><i>Postscript.</i></p>
<p class="bq">&ldquo;Sir: I have expressly sent this my footboy to prevent your departure
without some acknowledgment from me of the receipt of your
obliging letter; having myself through some business, I know not how,
neglected the ordinary conveyance. In any part where I shall understand
you fixed, I shall be glad and diligent to entertain you with
home-novelties, even for some fomentation of our friendship, too
soon interrupted in the cradle.&rdquo;</p>

The transition from the stately mood of the Attendant Spirit&rsquo;s
exordium to the noisy exhilaration of Comus is marked by appropriate
changes in the verse. Comus speaks in a lyric strain, and his tone
is exultant. When he comes to serious business, in <a href="#r7_145">line 145</a>, he also
employs blank-verse. The lyric lines, 93-144, rhyme in couplets, and
vary in length, most of them having four accents, while some have
five. The four-accent lines vary between seven and eight syllables,
many of them dropping the initial light syllable, or anakrusis (Auftakt).
These seven-syllable lines have a trochaic effect, but are to be
scanned as iambic, the standard rhythm of the poem. <b>The star
that bids the shepherd fold.</b> So Collins, in his ode To Evening,&mdash;&ldquo;For

<span class="pb">[111]</span>
Grammatically, <i>enough</i> is the better form, as the Elizabethan usage
favored <i>enough</i> for the form of the adjective with singular nouns and
for the adverb, and <i>enow</i> as the adjective with plurals. It would seem

<h3>LYCIDAS.</h3>
<p>Lycidas is Milton&rsquo;s contribution to a volume of elegiac verses, in
Greek, Latin, and English, composed by many college friends of
Edward King, who was drowned in the wreck of the vessel in
which he was crossing the Irish Channel.</p>
<p>In its main intention, Lycidas is an elegy, because it professes to
mourn one who is dead and extols his virtues. In its form it is
almost wholly pastoral, because it feigns an environment of shepherds,
allegorizing college life as the life of men tending flocks,
and the occupations of earnest students as the careless diversions
of rustic swains.</p>
<p>Four times the pastoral note is rudely interrupted by the intervention
of majestic beings who speak in awful tones from another
world, and whose voices instantly check all familiar rustic speech,
compelling it to wait till they have announced their messages from
above. The supernal powers who thus descend to take their parts
in the office of mourning are Ph&oelig;bus, Apollo, Hippotades, god
of the winds, Camus, god of the river Cam, and St. Peter. This
mingling of classic, Hebrew, and Christian conceptions is a marked
characteristic of all Milton&rsquo;s poetry.</p>
<p>Thus Lycidas is neither wholly elegiac nor wholly pastoral.
From the lips of St. Peter, typifying the church, comes a speech of
violent denunciation, in the true later Miltonic manner. In strange
contrast to this grim invective is the famous flower-passage, the
sweetest and loveliest thing of its kind in our literature.</p>

<p><a class="rref" id="n8_75" href="#r8_75">75. the blind Fury with the abhorred shears.</a>
Milton here seems
to ascribe to the Furies (Erinyes) the function belonging to the Fates
(Parc&aelig;, Moir&aelig;). The three Fates were Klotho, the Spinner; Lach&#277;sis,
the Assigner of lots; and Atr&#335;pos, the Unchanging. It was the duty
of Atropos to cut the thread of life at the appointed time.</p>
<p class="cont">A querulous thought comes to the poet&rsquo;s mind. Our lives are

Mantua, the birthplace of the poet Virgil. The great pastoral
poet Theocritus is said to have been born at Syracuse. Thus Arethusa
and the Mincius typify the pastoral tone in which Milton conceives
and constructs his poem. But the intervention of the great god
Apollo has frighted the bucolic muses, to whom therefore the poet
explains it, line 87.</p>

These lines evidently denounce some terrible retribution
that is sure ere long to overtake the corrupt clergy described in
the preceding passage. <b>The two-handed engine at the door, that

definitely explained. We naturally think of the headsman&rsquo;s
axe, which, however, does not become applicable till the execution
of Archbishop Laud, an event not to take place till eight years
after the composition of the poem. It has been suggested that
Milton had in mind the two houses of Parliament, or the Parliament
and the Army, as the agency through which reform was to be effected.
We must remember that Milton in 1637 could not foresee the Civil
War. He may have meant to combine certain scriptural expressions
into a mysteriously suggestive and oracular prediction, without
having in view any single and definite possibility.</p>

Milton is fond of thus collecting names of persons, places,

it matters not whether all these flowers could, or could not, be collected
at the same season, or whether they could be found at the time of the
year when Lycidas died. The passage offers a picture of exquisite

<h3>SONNETS.</h3>
<p>Of poems in strict sonnet form, that is, containing neither
more nor less than fourteen decasyllable iambic lines, interlocked
by some scheme of symmetrical rhyme, not in couplets, Milton left
twenty-three, of which five are in Italian. Of the three sonnets in
English omitted from this edition, two have reference to the violent
controversy occasioned by Milton&rsquo;s publications in advocacy of
greater freedom of divorce, and are rough and polemic in style;
the third is omitted on account of its unimportance and lack of
distinction.</p>
<p>In their dates the twenty-three sonnets range from the poet&rsquo;s
twenty-third to his fiftieth year. They are the only form of verse
in which he indulges during that middle period of his life which
was abandoned to political partisanship on the side of the Parliament
in the Civil War, and to the service of the government during
the Commonwealth and the Protectorate. If, as is now widely believed,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets are artificial and tell us little or
nothing about their author, those of Milton are purely natural and
subjective and tell us nothing else but what their writer was thinking
and feeling. Their themes are his veritable moods and passions.
The mood is now friendly, amiable, and serene, now bitter,
strenuous, indignant, vindictive.</p>
<p>Wordsworth, in his sonnet, <i>Scorn not the Sonnet</i>, thus refers to
Milton&rsquo;s sparing use of this poetic form:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t12">and when a damp</p>
<p class="t2">Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand</p>
<p class="t2">The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew</p>
<p class="t2">Soul-animating strains,&mdash;alas too few.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb">[123]</div>
<p>The Shakespearean sonnet consists of three quatrains followed
by a couplet,&mdash;the usual English form up to the seventeenth century.
Milton adopted the Italian, or Petrarchian model, which
has continued to be the standard sonnet form in our modern poetry.
In the Miltonic, or Italian, sonnet a group of eight lines, linked by
two rhymes each occurring four times, is followed by a group of
six lines linked by three rhymes each occurring twice. The octave
and the sextet are severed from each other by the non-continuance
of the rhymes of the former into the latter. At the end of the
octave, or near it, is usually a pause, marking the culmination of
the thought, and the sextet makes an inference or rounds out the
sense to an artistic whole.</p>
<p>Read Wordsworth&rsquo;s sonnets, <i>Happy the feeling from the bosom
thrown,</i> and <i>Nuns fret not at their convent&rsquo;s narrow room.</i></p>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>The date of this sonnet is unknown. From the fact that it
comes first in the series as arranged by the poet, it is inferred that
it is the earliest sonnet he chose to publish.</p>

To hear the nightingale before the cuckoo was for lovers a
good sign. This superstition is a motive in the
<i>Cuckoo and the Nightingale</i>, a poem formerly attributed to
Chaucer, and as such &ldquo;modernized&rdquo; by Wordsworth, but now
known to be the work of <b>Sir Thomas Clanvowe</b>. Stanza X of
this poem is thus given by Wordsworth:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">But tossing lately on a sleepless bed,</p>

This gives to the cuckoo altogether too
bad a character. The bird has on the whole a fair standing in English
poetry. We must think of the very pleasing <i>Ode to the Cuckoo</i>,&mdash;written
either by Michael Bruce or by John Logan,&mdash;as well as of the
passage in which Shakespeare makes Lucrece ask (line 848),&mdash;</p>

<h4>II (1631).</h4>
<p>This sonnet Milton appears to have sent with a prose letter to
a friend who had remonstrated with him on the life of desultory
study which he was so long continuing to lead. In this letter he
professes the principle of &ldquo;not taking thought of being <i>late</i>, so it
gave advantage to be more fit.&rdquo; He adds, &ldquo;That you may see
that I am something suspicious of myself, and do take notice of
a certain <i>belatedness</i> in me, I am the bolder to send you some of
my nightward thoughts some little while ago, because they come
in not altogether unfitly, made up in a Petrarchian stanza, which
I told you of.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>VIII (1642).</h4>
<p>The occasion of this sonnet was the near approach of the royalist
army to London, early in the Civil War. The people of the city
had reason to fear the entrance of the cavalier troops and the sacking
of the houses of citizens obnoxious to the party of the king.
Milton would have been an object of special animosity to victorious
royalists, and for a short time he had grounds for the acutest anxiety.
It is not easy to see how, in case of actual pillage of the city,
he could have made use of such an appeal as this. The sonnet is
probably to be regarded as a work of art constructed when the
vicissitudes which it pictures were happily past, and when the
poet&rsquo;s mind had regained its tranquillity.</p>

<h4>XVI.</h4>
<p>As Secretary for Foreign Tongues to the Council of State of the
Commonwealth, Milton saw much of Cromwell, and came under
the influence of his voice and manner. Whether the great general
had ever taken note of the poems written by the secretary who
turned his despatches into Latin, or whether he gave any special
heed to the man himself, with whom he must have come into some
sort of personal relation, we have no means of knowing. We know,
however, perfectly well what the poet thought of the victorious
general. Though by no means always approving his state policy,
Milton retained to the end the warm personal admiration for Cromwell
which he expresses in this sonnet.</p>

<h4>XVII (1652).</h4>
<p>Sir Henry Vane was member of a committee of the Council of
State appointed in 1649 to consider alliances and relations with the
European powers. Milton, as Secretary of the Council, had abundant
opportunity to observe Vane&rsquo;s skill in diplomacy, his ability
to &ldquo;unfold the drift of hollow states hard to be spelled.&rdquo; Both
Vane and Milton held to the doctrine, pre&euml;minently associated
with the name of Roger Williams, of universal toleration, based on
<span class="pb">[128]</span>
the refusal to the civil magistrate of any authority in spiritual
matters.</p>

<h4>XVIII (1655).</h4>
<p>The historical event which furnishes the occasion of this sonnet
is the persecution of the Protestant Waldenses by the Piedmontese
and French governments, at the time of Cromwell&rsquo;s Protectorate.
Cromwell&rsquo;s vigorous and successful intervention was the means of
staying this horror, and gives evidence of the respect entertained
for his government among the states of Europe.</p>

<p>The second sonnet to Cyriac Skinner determines its own date
as 1655, and this one is probably to be assigned to the same year.</p>
<p>But little is known of the person to whom this sonnet and the
next one are addressed, except what we learn from the sonnets
themselves,&mdash;that he was an intimate and esteemed friend of Milton.
He may have been one of Milton&rsquo;s pupils; and he may, when
his old teacher had become blind, have rendered him important
services as amanuensis or as reader.</p>
